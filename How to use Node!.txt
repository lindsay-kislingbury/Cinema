* When you make changes to any of the files, you need to restart the node server to see the changes.

* Don't delete the .gitignore file, we need this so that the npm package files don't get pushed to github, these are too large for github's limit.

* To download from github and run on your own machine, after opening the folder, run "npm install" to download the package dependencies. You need node installed to run it
